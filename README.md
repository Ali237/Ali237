- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on enhancing automated testing procedures for semiconductor devices, specializing in silicon wafer testing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about VHDL and system-level simulation to deepen my expertise in FPGA and ASIC design.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects involving embedded systems, semiconductor fabrication, and hardware design.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with advanced digital logic design and the integration of AI in embedded systems.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about semiconductor processing, PCB design using KiCad, LTSpice simulations, or programming in C/C++ for embedded applications.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [ebrabish@ualberta.ca](mailto:ebrabish@ualberta.ca) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghassan-ebrabish/).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started my journey in technology with a simple curiosity about how electronic devices are engineered to solve real-world problems.

### My Projects
Here are some projects I'm particularly proud of:
- **Automated Silicon Wafer Tester**: A project where I developed software in C/C++ to automate resistivity tests for silicon wafers, improving testing efficiency by 30%.
- **Robotic Hand Design**: Engineered a wireless robotic hand using flex sensors and servo motors, controlled via C/C++ on Arduino boards, showcasing my skills in both hardware and software integration.
- **Smart Traffic Light System**: Led a team to develop an optimized traffic management system using a Raspberry Pi, enhancing traffic flow efficiency demonstrated in a functional 3D-printed prototype.
